# Welcome to reactCustoms!

Hi there! I'm Azlan Ibrahim, a UX/UI Designer and Frontend Developer. Let me share the story behind these React hooks.

Few months ago, I embarked on my React journey through the excellent react course from **UI.DEV**. One of the standout features was their custom hooks section. Instead of just following along, they challenged us to build hooks ourselves before providing solutions. This approach really resonated with me, as it encouraged hands-on learning and problem-solving.

### Why I Created These Hooks

You might wonder, "Why create new hooks when UI.DEV already has a library?" Great question! Here's why:

1. **Learning and Growth**: While working through the challenges, I not only recreated existing hooks but also developed new ones based on ideas I had.

2. **Beginner-Friendly Approach**: I structured these hooks with new developers in mind, aiming for clarity and ease of use.

3. **GitHub and npm Experience**: This project has been an opportunity to familiarize myself with GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests, etc.) and the process of publishing to npm.

> A big shoutout to the **UI.DEV** team for their inspiring course structure and content!
